R1 - I think this had no mementum source - wecivil (and sherlock)
R2 - good standard run but no internal probes, large course mesh - wecivil
R3 - Test of geometry setup, probes may be in the wrong place for Nat Vent. Course mesh, ~700k - wecivil
R4 - Internal probes. First run with geometry built directly from python. Finer mesh, 10 elements per window, 4M - wecivil
R5 - Testing R4 with interp restart from R2 - sherlock
R6 - Running course mesh with 90 deg flow, ~700k - wecivil
R7 - Running from R5 with added outputs - sherlock
R8 - Running 45 deg, ~700k - wecivil
R9 - Running from R7, 4M. CFL too high, need to rerun - sherlock
R10 - Running 45 deg from R8,  4M - sherlock
R11 - Trying to run equivalent of R7 with 6m house and random turbulence initialization, 4M - sherlock [1400 takes about 4:20]
R12 - Testing scaling of runnin 1 node instead of 4 (R11)
R13 - Testing effect of output on run speed by removing all outputs [ran to 1400 in 1 hr]
R14 - Testing probes insted of pointcloud_probes. Get similar performance to R13 even with outputs [ran 2800 in 2 hr]
