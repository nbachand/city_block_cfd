R1 - I think this had no mementum source - wecivil (and sherlock)
R2 - good standard run but no internal probes, large course mesh - wecivil
R3 - Test of geometry setup, probes may be in the wrong place for Nat Vent. Course mesh, ~700k - wecivil
R4 - Internal probes. First run with geometry built directly from python. Finer mesh, 10 elements per window, 4M total - wecivil
R5 - Testing R4 with interp restart from R2 - sherlock
R6 - 90 deg. Spinning up run for other wind direction. Course mesh ~700k - wecivil
